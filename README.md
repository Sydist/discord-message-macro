# Discord Message Macro (Deno)
Post messages, get messages, but honestly we're all here to bully George.

## Getting Started

### Using the CLI

Currently, there is no GUI version, but I might make one. (Don't count on it lol.)

1. First, install [Deno].
2. Download sources.
3. Add a file named `.env` with your discord token inside in this format:  
    DISCORD_USER_TOKEN = `PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE`
4. Open example.ts and remove the slashes before the funciton you want to use.
5. Add the user channel's id you want to connect to and the message you want to post if any.
